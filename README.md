# Student Information Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing student information to answer three key questions related to academic performance and administrative planning.

## Questions Addressed
1. Which department has the highest average GPA, and how does it vary across departments?
2. What is the relationship between GPA and student age?
3. How does GPA correlate with graduation year?

## Files
